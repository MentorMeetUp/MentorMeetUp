# Mentor Me

## Everyone is good at something!

 This web app connects people who have a particular skill with someone who would like to learn more about it. This could be a professional skill such as coding or marketing or a hobby such as juggling or photography. The "Mentor" decides if they want to get paid to teach someone what they know about their skill and how much or if they don't mind sharing that information for free. The "Protégé" can search for the skill they are interested in leaning and choose a "Mentor" to contact based on a photo and a quick bio. The two parites can enter a formal or informal agreement and negotiate payment if applicable.
